# The plan: where we stand

Only what is still to build. When a round is built, its spec and summary move to `docs/built.md` in the same
commit (see CLAUDE.md), so this file stays short. After each round: that round's own test part
(plus `text_fits` when text changed), push (CI runs the whole suite and builds), a short Dutch report. The full run
(seeds 1-3, smoke, bot) happens once, at the end of a build, before merging to main. Nilio plays afterwards and sends feedback.

Inspiration: Shadowdark (core book, Western Reaches, Cursed Scrolls 1-6), D&D, Pathfinder, Diablo, Final Fantasy,
WoW. Take the ideas, never the text, stat blocks or invented names.

## At a glance

| Status | What |
|---|---|
| **Built** | Everything up to the magic schools, the debug menu, the weapons and the classes: see `docs/built.md` (summaries and the specs of built rounds) |
| **Approved: spell effects** | Parts 1 and 2 built 19 and 22 October 2026 (the toolkit, status colours, Wild Shape colours, the option, each school's own hand, the storm's white frame; see `docs/built.md`). Left: the weapon skills' effects, with the weapon skills |
| **Approved: dungeons on their own land** | Built places that stand outside (temple, abbey, tower, fort, manor) start on their own play map with land around them; upper floors and cellars by stairs; each kind its own plan, bigger levels, wider halls, one telling thing per room, a mood line in the messages. Caves stay underground. Underground kinds their own plan too; hand-drawn pieces in data files and an editor for Nilio; classic dungeons from a random maker (rooms of many shapes grow onto the level, main ways 3 wide, narrow ways 1 wide, every passage from room to room). The random maker, the theme rooms, rivers underground and the pieces format are built (24 October 2026), and so are the temples, towers, barrows, abbeys, forts, manors, goblin places and the underground kinds' plans; the editor waits until much later (`docs/open.md`) |
| **Parked** | The bard; the werewolf's and the vampire's curse (docs/parked.md) |
| **Later** | Crafts guilds, leadership, a house of your own |

**The build order** (settled with Nilio 23 October 2026, thread "Bouwvolgorde plan.md"; the Dutch proposal with the
reasons: project files `bouw/volgorde.md`). 32 rounds in 9 blocks (the great evils and trade added 25 October 2026, the boss fights 26 October). Sizes: S like market day, M like spell effects
part 2, L like herds and hunting, XL like the magic schools. No play builds in between (Nilio, 23 October 2026): he plays only when all blocks are built, through the last round, now 32 (Nilio, 25 October 2026: the play build only at the end), so the
"pauses" below are only clean points to stop at when his usage limit runs low. The full test run and the merge to
`main` come at the end of each block; CI keeps testing every push. Each block starts on Nilio's "ga".

## The UI rule for every new round

Everything new finds its place in what is there; no new screen per system, no new letter keys in play:
- **A list or a record** (realms, lords and houses, dishes, herds, wonders) goes in a tab of the journal (e).
- **Something spread over the land** (realms and borders, herds, seasons) goes in a layer of the world map (m),
  with its own legend line. The realms layer becomes key 4, after Factions.
- **Something about where you stand** (the realm or baron, the wind when hunting, the zone) goes on the line under
  the map. **Something in a fight** goes in IN SIGHT.
- **A new sign** is named by the data (tile names, `guide.py`), so the look legend and the journal's Signs know it.
- **A new key** is taught by one tip in `guide.TIPS` the first time it is useful, not by text on the screen.

## Spell effects (approved; parts 1 and 2 built)

**Part 1 built 19 October 2026 as a quick win, part 2 on 22 October** (see `docs/built.md`): the toolkit (bolts with
a tail, bursts, drain, rising crosses, the zigzag), status colours on creatures, Wild Shape's colours, monsters'
arrows and spells, the option full/short/off; each school its own hand (rings and waves, Meteor's shadow and slanting
fall, the corpse that greys and rises, Morrak's Bargain, walls one stone at a time) and the one white frame of Call
the Storm. **Left:** only the weapon skills' effects, built with the weapon skills (proposal in the project files,
`magie/wapeneffecten/voorstel.md`). The spec below is the whole plan.

Approved by Nilio on 17 October 2026 after two rounds of animated mockups (project files `magie/effecten/`, 17 GIFs,
made by `magie/effecten_mockups.py` and `effecten_mockups2.py`; every spell's effect in `magie/effecten.md` and
`magie/effecten_rest.md`). Today a spell flashes once for ~0.2 s (`engine.py` `flash`).

- **A small toolkit every school shares:** bolts that fly cell by cell with a fading tail; impacts that open out in
  three or four frames (`*` `+` `·`); particles flying back to you (life drain); rising `+` (heals); rings and
  waves; lasting colour on a creature (burning flickers orange, frozen has a pale blue ground, poisoned pulses
  green, weakened is dimmed); living tiles (burning ground, ice walls, roots, thorns, bone walls, Ball Lightning).
  Big spells draw light in for a frame before they strike.
- **Each school its own hand:** Meteor throws its shadow first and falls in at a slant; lightning is a white zigzag
  that fades to yellow and hops target to target; a corpse `%` greys and rises as `z`; Morrak's Bargain pulls your
  own life out in red first. Monsters' spells use the same effects, so you see what is coming.
- **Small areas.** Ordinary area spells (tome rank 0-30) have radius 1, a 3x3; big ones (42 and up) and the guilds'
  top techniques radius 2; never more than 3, and 3 only for the heaviest (Morrak's Bargain, Army of the Dead).
  Spells that pick targets (Chain Lightning, Call the Storm, Tempest) are not areas. Firebolt hits only its target;
  Grasping Roots and Entangle make a 3x3 of roots.
- **Wild Shape stays `@`.** You keep your sign and take the beast's colours (bear: orange-brown on dark brown, wolf:
  white on slate grey), so you never lose yourself on the map; the shape and its turns show with your buffs.
- **Calm:** no effect lasts longer than ~0.4 s, a key skips it, the game never waits for one; no screen shake, no
  flashing screen except one frame for a great lightning stroke; colours from the school (`DISC_COLOR`). An option:
  effects full, short or off.
- **In the code:** a small queue of effect frames in `anim.py`, drawn over the map in the existing draw loop and its
  timer (`GameScreen.moving`); `flash()` becomes a one-frame effect, so all that flashes today keeps working.
- **Weapon skills' effects** (proposal with GIFs in `magie/wapeneffecten/`; built with the weapon skills): steel and
  dust, no school colour; a swing arc only on skills and critical hits (an ordinary bump stays the short flash);
  blood on Sever Artery and claws, and a bleeding foe leaves a red trail `,` for a few turns (Nilio, 22 October).

## Dungeons on their own land (approved 22 October 2026, not built)
Today every dungeon level is 84 x 50 and made by one of two makers (rooms strung west to east, or a cellular cave); the kinds differ only in dressing, monsters and depth. Overview, 15 example levels and mockups: `/mnt/project-files/dungeons/` (`uitleg.md`, `mockups/`). Inspired by laughingpanjandrum's ASCII maps (Tomb of King Oraine, Church of the Ailing Flower).
- **Built places start outside** (built for temples, towers and barrows, 24 October 2026; see `docs/built.md`). A place that stands on the land (temple, abbey or monastery, tower, fort, manor, and other buildings on the world map) starts on its own play map with land around it, matching the world-map terrain: you walk in from the edge, through a gate or a door. An upper floor (a tower, a bell loft) and cellars or a crypt are their own levels, reached by stairs. Caves, dens, nests and mines still start straight underground. Mockup C.
- **Each kind its own plan.** A temple has a nave with pews and pillars, a transept, chapels and an altar; an abbey a cloister round a garden, a refectory and cells; a tomb a procession hall and burial galleries. You can tell from the map what the place is. Mockups A and C.
- **Bigger and roomier**, for fights with hirelings and spells: levels up to 120 x 70 (sizes per kind below), halls two or three wide. Ties in with Nilio's later wish for bigger play maps (the map view now shows 80 x 51).
- **Built walls are thin joined lines** (as town houses already draw them), one wall between neighbouring rooms, never a double one; caves keep their raw rock.
- **Mixed levels** when a job or the story asks: a built tomb that breaks into a cave (mockup B). Caves may be bigger too, with several great halls.
- **One telling thing per room** (a pool, a row of statues, an altar, a sarcophagus), always a tile used with one key or a bump.
- **A mood line**: the first time you step into a room, the messages say what it is ("The nave. Rotten pews face a cracked altar.").
- **Hand-drawn pieces** (the way of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup): the format is built (24 October 2026; `pieces/README.txt`, `pieces.py`, see "The K5 maker" in `docs/built.md`). Left for the fixed plans: a kind's plan laid out first and its rooms filled with fitting pieces; unique places once per world.
- **Events in pieces**: the when / if / then rules are built in the pieces format (24 October 2026). The editor that would draw pieces waits, much later (`docs/open.md`).
- **The random maker for classic dungeons (K5)** is built (24 October 2026, see "The K5 maker" in `docs/built.md`); the fixed plans set their theme rooms in their own spots.
- **Settled 22 October.**
  - **Which places start outside:** the temple, abbey or monastery, tower, fort, manor and barrow. Caves, dens, nests and mines start straight underground.
  - **Which maker:** classic dungeons and ruins use the K5 maker, with theme rooms set into them. The other kinds get a fixed plan of their own; an abbey, for example, always has a cloister, a refectory and cells.
  - **Goblin places come in two kinds.** The big delve with a market hall, a forge, family halls and the chief's hall is a goblin village and gets built like a settlement. An ordinary goblin hole gets its own, smaller plan in the same spirit.
  - **Below a temple or a fort** lie 3 to 5 levels of crypt or dungeon; the number varies.
  - **Stairs** may come out anywhere on the next level.
  - **Sizes, in three steps.** The map view already follows the hero on maps bigger than the screen. Sizes can be tuned later.
    - **Small, one screen, 80 x 50:** the manor, the barrow, an ordinary goblin hole and a beast's den.
    - **Middle, 100 x 60:** the temple, the abbey, the fort, and the levels below them.
    - **Large, 120 x 70:** classic dungeons, caves and the goblin village.
    - **Now and then very large, 150 x 90:** a special place, such as the bottom level or one of Nilio's unique places.
- **Theme rooms** are built for K5 (24 October 2026, see "The K5 maker" in `docs/built.md`): 38 drawn pieces in `pieces/theme.des`, with the arrival and bottom rooms. Still to come with the fixed plans: the entrance part, and each people flavouring a room (a dwarf shrine with a forge altar, a goblin library of stolen books).

## Boss fights: what is left (approved 26 October 2026)

The kit, the library and the boss maker are built (`docs/built.md`, "Boss fights"). Not built yet, for a later
round: arenas dressed per place (tower top, temple nave and the rest) and the ways out other than the rotten wall;
the place that wakes or falls in after a few bosses; fights won another way (hold out, rescue, break it, escape);
bosses for the big one (a fish) and the relic job.

---

## Parked
- **The bard** (the Lark's Company): see docs/parked.md. Not until Nilio says so.

## Later (not planned yet)
- The dungeon editor (much later, after all open blocks; Nilio, 24 October 2026): see `docs/open.md`, "Dungeon editor".
- Crafts guilds: smith and weaponsmith (mend and improve), herbalist, hunter-tanner (hides and trophies).
- Leadership: more hirelings, a group buff. A house of your own, with taxes.
- World ideas proposed with round 5 but not chosen: smoke over villages seen from afar, birds flushing from woods
  before an ambush, vultures over fights, the world growing (new hamlets, logging, regrowth), worn paths,
  lighthouses and watchtowers lit at night.
